# Untitled Horror Project

## Overview
Aim is to go through the mansion and release/trap the ghosts & monsters.
Storyline - The player doesn't have a specific story (stumbles into mansion with amnesia) but each of the ghost/monsters do

## Mechanics
1. Adrenaline
   1. Allows you to run faster and see more but only for a limited time
   2. Max 30 secs every couple mins or something like that
2. Heartbeats
   1. If heart rate goes too high adrenaline kicks in
   2. if heart rate is too high for too long, player passes out
3. Lights
   1. amnesia style tinderboxes, candles and lantern
4. Adaptive map & scenery
   1. Hallways extend when player is scared
   2. Rooms change and become scarier
   3. Lightning flashes and scary faces seen in shadows
5. Morality meter
   1. Releasing spirirts improves morality level, trapping them lowers it.
   2. Low morality
      1. Ghosts are more likely to be hostile
      2. Insanity raising faster
   3. High morality
      1. Ghosts are less likely to be hostile
      2. Insanity raises slower
